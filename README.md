# BAXI POWER METER


This component provides integration with Baxi branded power meter
## How to install
You can use HACS to install this integration as custom repository

If you are not using HACS, you must copy `baxi_power-meter` into your `custom_components` folder

## Configuration
Configuration via integration is recommended. Add an instance of `Baxi Power meter` using the UI:

And follow the steps:
![](https://github.com/vipial1/BAXI_power-meter/blob/main/images/configuration.png?raw=true)


Integration will create an entity for energy consumption and a Device (only if configured using UI)


## Work in progress
- Super huge refactor (code is completely shitty now)
- Lots (seriously, lots) of bugs to be fixed.
- Multidevice not tested, probably not working
- Translation
